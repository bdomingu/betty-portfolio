            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Betty, a software developer with a background in Mathematics and Education.
            My interest in software development began in college while pursuing my degree in mathematics.
            I took a programming class and I enjoyed the fact that I could build something and see it 
            right away. I have always been passionate about problem-solving and teaching people how to 
            problem solve and use their critical thinking skills. While being a Mathematics Teacher for 
            2 years, I decided to learn to program on the side. I fell in love with the endless possibilities.
            I love that with programming, you are constantly learning and always challenged and in that sense, 
            it reminds me of mathematics. I also enjoy that I can build things for people to use. I am constantly
            learning new things and working on improving my programming skills. I consider myself a disciplined 
            and diligent worker, and team player, who is passionate about learning and has exceptional communication
            skills and values.</p>
